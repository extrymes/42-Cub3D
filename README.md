# 42-Cub3D
## Overview
**Cub3d** is a graphical project from **42 School** that involves creating a **simple 3D game engine using raycasting**. It is inspired by early 90s games like Wolfenstein 3D and aims to render a first-person 3D view based on a 2D map. The project covers several topics such as graphics rendering, handling input, and managing game mechanics like player movement and collision detection. It is designed to give students experience with low-level graphics programming and event-driven game loops.

## Getting started
This project is compatible on Linux and macOS.
> If you are on macOS, make sure you have installed **Xcode Command Line Tools**.
1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/extrymes/42-Cub3D.git
cd 42-Cub3D
```
2. Compile and launch the program
```bash
make
./cub3d <maps/map.cub>
```
The map file must be in `.cub` format, as indicated in the cub3d specifications.

## Map requirements
Maps must conform to cub3d specifications, which are the following:
- The map must be composed of **only 6 possible characters**: `0` for an empty space, `1` for a wall, and `N`, `S` ,`E` or `W` for the playerâ€™s starting position and spawning orientation.
- The map must be **surrounded by walls**.
- Except for the map content, each type of element can be separated by one or more empty line(s).
- Except for the map content which always has to be the last, each type of element can be set in any order in the file.
- The map must be parsed as it looks in the file. Spaces are a valid part of the map.
- Each element (except the map) first information is the type identifier (composed by one or two character(s)), followed by all specific informations for each object in a strict order such as:
	- NO ./path/to/the/north/texture
	- SO ./path/to/the/south/texture
	- WE ./path/to/the/west/texture
	- EA ./path/to/the/east/texture
	- F 70,70,70 (floor color)
	- C 80,180,220 (ceiling color)

The `maps` folder already contains some maps but you can create your own!
